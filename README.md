Welcome to the Super Qool Live Music Festival, my topic was concert hall.

The festival has 4 areas, each of them has some concerts performed on.
Each area has some assigned toilets, food and drinks and security. Employees have their merchandise or food and drinks stand assigned.
Toilets and Security come in packs. Each toilet id represents 20 toilets. And every security pack represents 12 men.
The festival lasts two days. Depending on your ticket you may acces to both days.
Some concerts are performed on day one, the rest are perfromed on day two.
Concerts have their own instruments, however drums are shared depending on the area and not the band, because they cannot be moved.
Concerts have dancers, sound engenieers as well.

Didn't create an user table, since in a real world festival its imposible to know wich user is attending wich concert.
Tickets table has a name, a national id and email so you can know who attended the festival.
